# CVRP Solver with Sweeping Algorithm

This project implements a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) solver using a sweeping algorithm, built with React.js. CVRP is a classic problem in optimization and logistics where the goal is to determine the most efficient set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers while respecting capacity constraints.
